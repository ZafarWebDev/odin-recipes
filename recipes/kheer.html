    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Kheer, a beloved dessert in Pakistan, is a traditional rice pudding that holds a special place in the hearts of many. This creamy and rich dish is made by slowly cooking rice in full-fat milk until it becomes tender and absorbs the milk's flavors. The pudding is sweetened with sugar and often flavored with cardamom, which adds a warm, aromatic touch.</p>

    <p>In Pakistani households, kheer is often garnished with a variety of toppings, including slivers of almonds, pistachios, and raisins, which not only enhance its visual appeal but also add texture and flavor. Some variations may include saffron for a luxurious touch and a beautiful golden hue.</p>
